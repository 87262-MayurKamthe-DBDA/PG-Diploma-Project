# Surge Price Prediction of Cabs Using Machine Learning Algorithms 
Developed a model to analyze factors like cab demand, supply, time, day, and weather to predict fair pricing. The system provides users with a single interface to compare fares, ensuring transparent payments and preventing overcharges. 
Additionally, it helps optimize the demand-supply ratio by monitoring surge pricing and guiding drivers/service providers to high-demand areas. Used by mobility service companies to enhance user experience and market efficiency.
